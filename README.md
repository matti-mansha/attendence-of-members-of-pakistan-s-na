Who to vote in the next elections?
Today we are living in 21st century where most of the countries are following nation-state system and democracy. People have the power to choose their rulers by voting. It is the need of the time that we should know who we are choosing so we may actively take part in growth of our country and our society.

Above is the picture of National Assembly of Pakistan. It contains members all over the country chosen by its citizens after every five years. The dataset we are using contains the Complete Attendance record of Pakistan's National Assembly from Assembly's First Session on September 17, 2018 to Session 43 on June 28, 2022 (elections will be commenced after a year). Attendence is often a good yardstick to know the devotion of someone to his/her job. So here, we will get to know how punctual the NA members are to the Assembly sessions using this dataset. Citizens will be able to decide whom should they elect after a year based on data not on intuition.
Disclaimer: Attendence of NA members in assembly sessions is not the only nor the most accurate to efficiency of a member, but it is still some food for thought for a responsible voter. Please view this notebook keeping the above ideas in your mind.
